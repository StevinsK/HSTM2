        <h1>What is Diabetes?</h1>
        <p>A metabolic abnormality that results in the alteration of insulin action, leading to poorly controlled sugar levels in the body, usually causing high glucose levels in the blood.</p>
        <p>The goal of management is to maintain the levels of sugars to near normal.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Definition of Terms:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hyperglycemia:</strong> - blood glucose level higher than normal</li>
                    <li><strong>Hypoglycemia:</strong> - blood glucose level lower than normal</li>
                    <li><strong>Fasting blood glucose:</strong> sugar level measured after fasting for a certain period (such as overnight)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Types of Diabetes Mellitus:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Type 1 DM:</strong> - results in complete or near-total lack of insulin, requiring lifetime insulin administration</li>
                    <li><strong>Type 2 DM:</strong> - a group of disorders characterized by variable degrees of insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion, and increased hepatic glucose production</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The expected values for normal fasting blood glucose concentration are between 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) and 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L).</p>
        <p>When fasting blood glucose is between 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L), changes in lifestyle and monitoring glycemia are recommended. If fasting blood glucose is 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests, diabetes is diagnosed.</p>
        <p>An individual with low fasting blood glucose concentration (hypoglycemia) – below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) – will experience <em>dizziness, sweating, palpitations, blurred vision</em>, and other symptoms that have to be monitored and corrected.</p>
        <p>Increased fasting blood glucose concentration (hyperglycemia) is an indicator of a higher risk of diabetes.</p>
        <p>Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are preceded by a period of progressive worsening of glucose homeostasis, followed by the development of hyperglycemia.</p>

        <h2>Overview of Type 1 DM</h2>
        <p>Type 1 diabetes affects approximately 5% to 10% of all people with diabetes. It usually has an acute onset before 30 years of age and is characterized by destruction of the pancreatic beta cells due to a combination of genetic, immunological, epigenetic, and environmental factors. In genetically susceptible children, compliance to early infant feeding is a possible way to reduce type 1 diabetes.</p>
        <p>Although the events that precipitate beta-cell destruction are not fully understood, it is generally accepted that a genetic susceptibility is a common underlying factor in the development of type 1 diabetes. People do not inherit type 1 diabetes itself; rather, they inherit a <b>genetic predisposition to type 1 diabetes</b>, which might be triggered by environmental factors.</p>
        <p>The destruction of the beta cells results in decreased insulin production, unchecked glucose production by the liver, and fasting hyperglycemia. In addition, glucose derived from food cannot be stored in the liver and remains in the bloodstream, contributing to postprandial (after meal) hyperglycemia.</p>
        <p>If the concentration of glucose in the blood exceeds the renal threshold for glucose, usually 9 to 11 mmol/L, the kidneys may not reabsorb all of the filtered glucose, and glucose appears in the urine (glucosuria). When excess glucose is excreted in the urine, it is accompanied by excessive loss of fluids and electrolytes, which is called osmotic diuresis. Insulin inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. In people with insulin deficiency, these processes are not restrained and contribute to hyperglycemia. In addition, the breakdown of fatty acids results in increased production of ketone bodies, which lead to ketoacidotic states and death if the insulin deficiency is not corrected.</p>
